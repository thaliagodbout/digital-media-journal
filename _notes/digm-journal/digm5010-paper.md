<div class="overview">
Notes, thoughts, and reflections on the process of developing my DIGM 5010 research paper.
</div>



I created some notes that document my process for developing my research paper for DIGM 5010 - including the stages throughout class that provided guidance and structure, along with my thoughts, reflections, and learnings from the process.

A lot of my idea-forming process involves **jotting down rough notes** capturing any interesting thoughts that pop up as I go about my day doing other things - most often on the subway or in the middle of other activities like walking, cooking, or grabbing groceries. I like to marinate them in my brain and don't tend to document my thought process well, so journalling about it after the fact feels a bit unnatural (but it's been a very useful reflection activity).

Right now, I take these notes in my **travellers notebook** - I like it because it allows me to keep my quick notes from different areas of my life separate and organized into different interchangeable books. I'll include scans from my rough notes on these pages.

## Research Process Outline

Okay, so I chose to split this process across multiple notes. I rambled way too much and it became gigantic on one page. You can find notes on each stage of the process on the following pages:

- [[annotated-bibliographies|Early Explorations and Annotated Bibliographies]]
- [[fermenting|Exploring Fermentation]]
- More to come

## I'm not done with this! ah! eep!

There'll be more here soon. I'm still trying to transfer my messy notes into something readable here. If you're Graham, pls come back soon!! &#128534;
