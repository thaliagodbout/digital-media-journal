## What is Reproducing Research?

- There is a difference between *reading* and *recreating* research
- **Re-creating research:** "Perhaps I could do this differently, modify this or that"...so that we can *extend the research beyond where it got before*
- Even if you do project work that doesn't answer your thesis questions - *it's still worth documenting!*
    - Negative results are not necessarily a bad thing
    - For example, how [Yellowtail](https://www.flong.com/archive/projects/yellowtail/index.html) helped Golan Levin to create his research question/objective - there is a healthy balance of critique in the paper's section on Yellowtail

## After Reproducing Research

- Once we reproduce research, how can we extend it beyond?
- For example, with Yellowtail, there are many ways we could modify it:
    - Colour, line width, opacity
    - Vary opacity/colour depending on speed
    - Maybe you can stop the animations in some form
    - Adjust the animations cycles' tempos/periods
    - Give the lines/animations autonomy
    - Sound
    - Questions around mapping

- Critique what happened - what didn't work, what could be done differently or better?
- This can help think about where to take it next
