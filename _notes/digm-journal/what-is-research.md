<div class="overview">
Super rough point-form notes from class on a discussion around what research is.
</div>

- Pushing out of edges of a circle, finding the liminal zones and passageways
- One definition is "increasing the stock of knowledge"
    - What are the issues with this definition?
    - What is "*the*" stock of knowledge?
        - ethnocentric
        - there isn't just one "world" or "stock"
        - what is recognized as valid "new" knowledge?
- Research is built on **sharing**
    - What qualities do you look for in research? (maybe depth, relevance, specificity, effectiveness, trustworthiness, usability...?)
- Research usually involve:
    - Asking a novel question, showing it's worth exploring
    - Doing some work to respond, showing it's done well
    - Communicating knowledge in a way that can be built upon

## The Research Qestion / Problem Statement

- Personal motivation
- How do we know what we don't know?
    - Scholarly grounding, literature reviews: finding gaps in literative reviews can help lead to research questions
    - Often the problem statement isn't apparent from the start
    - Grounded speculation can help to refine an idea!
- Research can often be speculative - pointing to the future
    - What does the world, culture, discipline, etc. need?
    - What are some important questions in your field?
    - What is this missing? What have we missed?
    - What are we missing by viewing the future through a rearview mirror (grounded in the past)
- Stepping outside of the field is important - sometimes we may miss things or make many assumptions
- Working towards a problem definition
    - Early stages: diagrams, maps, keywords can be very useful for refining an idea!
    - Using literature:
        - Clearly identify the area you're "advancing"
        - What assumptions are you overthrowing?
- **Deep and narrow scope** is great for research questions (instead of wide and shallow)
    - Literature review will be wide and shallow (exploring the edges)
    - Deep and narrow can help to expand on specifics
- You don't need to fit everything into your research!! It's okay to focus on one thing

- I noted this quote down but I'm actually not sure who said it - was it Graham, another student, or a quote from someone else?
    > "Take your brain, throw it into the future as far as you can. Take something said to be impossible and make it!"

## Art as Research

- Research creation: the creation process is situated within the research activity and produces critically informed work in a variety of media / art forms
- SSHRC has definitions for research-creation proposals: a sustained, reflective research set directly and actively within the creation process itself
