Brief reflections on submitting my [[digm5010-paper|DIGM 5010 Research Paper]] to ISEA 2025.
</div>

I wasn't originally planning to submit my paper to ISEA since I thought it might not suit this year's themes. After more thought (and presenting to the class which helped clarify my ideas), I realized these ideas could maybe be a way to generate discussion and inspire artists and creators to explore these ideas further in their work, and figured I'd prepare a last minute submission.

In restrospect, I think these ideas would have better suited a collaborative workshop format - which I'd like to explore in the future was a generative research output to create spaces for these discussions.

I also learned a lot about the process of submitting conference papers (and using Overleaf with the conference paper LaTeX template along with Zotero as a reference manager was a godsend for a last minute formatting job). Going through that process made the idea of conference submissions much less scary.

Through this, I also discovered that the [ISEA 2024 theme](https://isea2024.isea-international.org/theme/), *the Everywhen*, included a sub theme on Shifting Temporalities to "question conventional temporal boundaries and the relationships time, perception, and creative expression within the context of rapidly advancing technologies and cultural changes" and " foster connections between human and non-human temporalities". Wouldn't this have been so perfect!!
