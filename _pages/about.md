# About this space

I created this space to document my notes, studies, and practices throughout my MSc Digital Media program. (Mostly for a course journal, but maybe I'll continue growing this space beyond that.)

This digital garden is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I'm experimenting with writing my Markdown files using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which I love for its backlinks and graph views.

This website was built on Maxime Vaillancourt's free, open-source template, which you can find on the [Digital Garden Jekyll Template GitHub repository](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template). If you want to do the same, you can check out their [step-by-step guide explaining how to set this up from scratch](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).
