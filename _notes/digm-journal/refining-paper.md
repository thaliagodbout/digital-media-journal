More notes I took as I continued to refine my [[digm5010-paper|DIGM 5010 Research Paper]].

After [[fermenting|exploring the fermenting of kimchi and sourdough]], I dove back into reading and researching temporality in technology, along with fermentation and how it's been explored as a metaphor and framework for talking and thinking through ideas. This largely included (but wasn't limited to) work by [Lauren Fournier](https://cargocollective.com/laurenfournier) and the contributors to her curatorial project, [Fermenting Feminism](https://cargocollective.com/laurenfournier/Fermenting-Feminism-1).

Here are some notes that I wrote while refining the research questions and structure for my paper.
