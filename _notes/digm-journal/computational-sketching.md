title: Computational Sketching
---
In Week 1 of Foundations of Digital Media, we talked about [John Maeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maeda)'s explorations in interactive graphics in combining computation with traditional art techniques.

A few key takeaways from [Graham's Week 1 notes on computational sketching](https://alicelab.world/digm5010/#computational-sketching):
- "the most **interesting** pixels on the screen are the mouse"
- "the mouse represents not just **space** but also **time** -- use it"

This goes back to our discussion about [[what-makes-something-interesting|what makes something interesting]]. These most interesting pixels that Maeda talks about represent **you** in the digital space - this could be the cursor of your pointing device, or perhaps your focus indicator. It situates you in a digital environment, and it's your gateway to interacting with elements in this environment.

## Learning about 2D drawing in class
While I've used [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) in the past (and I adore it), I'd never really used JavaScript's Canvas API directly.

Following along with Graham in class (and slightly modifying his example), I made a quick sketch that creates [[pseudorandomness|random]] colourful threads when you move the cursor. Clicking the canvas wipes it clean.

It reminds me of my colourful piles of thread cuttings that keep growing - I don't know why I hang onto those but I do think they're pretty.
