## Discussing Steering Behaviour Research

- We discussed a paper on steering behaviours: [Craig Reynolds. Steering Behaviors For Autonomous Characters, Game Developers Conference. 1999 ](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/gdc99/)
    - Some notes about the structure of this paper:
        - It has a great example of an abstract! (Goals, why, one sentence summary)
        - Explains what an autonomous agent is, what it is not - important for interdisciplinary fields where terms can mean very different (or similar) things
        - Conclusion summarizes - 1 sentence per major point
- Reynolds' boids are a model of flocking behaviour, which is prevalent in the natural world (observed in flocks of birds, schools of fish)
- Reynolds breaks down these behaviours into 3 major components:
    - Action Selection
    - Steering (where he defined different algorithms modelling steering behaviours)
    - Locomotion
