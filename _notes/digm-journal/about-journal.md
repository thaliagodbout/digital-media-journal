<div class="overview">
A bit about why and how I made this site for my DIGM 5010 journal/garden.
</div>

## Why I made this

I created this space to document my notes, studies, and explorations for DIGM 5010. I'm hoping to continue growing this space beyond that as a journal throughout the Digital Media graduate program.

I've been interested in **Digital Gardening** - in constantly evolving personal notebooks that I could tend to, with often unpolished, loose thoughts that focus more on the process than a final product. This was an excuse to explore that a tiny bit!

Lately, my interests in Digital Gardens have been inspired by a few peoples' writings and works:

- [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)
- [My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?](https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/)
- [Gardens in the Computer](https://hypha.coop/dripline/gardens-in-the-computer/)
- [Joel Hooks - My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)
- [Tom Critchlow - Building a digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/)
- [Eva Decker - The Garden](https://eva.town/garden)

## How I made this

This digital garden is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). For most of DIGM 5010, I've been writing my Markdown files using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (where I connected my vault to my git repo), which I've been wanting to try out for its backlinks and graph views.

*(I ended up mostly just writing Markdown in VSCode for this journal because I was more comfortable with it... though I do want to continue using Obsidian for my other notes!)*

This website was built on Maxime Vaillancourt's free, open-source template, which you can find on the [Digital Garden Jekyll Template GitHub repository](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template). If you want to do the same, you can check out their [step-by-step guide explaining how to set this up from scratch](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).
