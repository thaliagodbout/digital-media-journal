## Bringing Fermentation Into It

As we were approaching reading week, I was preparing to visit my parents - my mom and I had been planning to make kimchi with a friend and her mom, who was visiting from Korea and bringing her own mother's homemade gochugaru.

My mom has been making large batches of kimchi lately with communities of students from the college campus she lives on, turning the act of fermentation into a collaborative act that brings people together, sharing the fruits of this collective labour with students, family, and friends within and beyond these circles. When my friends come over, she offers them a jar to take home. It's been fascinating to watch how these jars of bubbling, lively, fermented cabbage have been carefully cultivated by many different hands in my mother's kitchen, to be distributed to new hands and bellies. (We are not Korean - we're Vietnamese, though my mom loves fermented foods and has recently been really into learning from [Maangchi](https://www.maangchi.com/) and her Korean friends.)

Thinking about this making of kimchi as a slow, collaborative process around care and community sharing, I wondered how these values could apply to the way we understand technologies. When my mother invites groups of people over to make kimchi, it's not to create a kimchi assembly line for speed and efficiency - she does this for people to share this experience together, to learn and create together, to connect, and to care for them by providing a home-away-from-home. It is a slow and labourous process that she engages with to foster and care for her community, while preparing and preserving delicious, long-lasting food bursting with nutritional value to share with herself and others.

I wrote down some questions around fermentation as a process and practice on this notebook page.

**What if we cared for our technologies (both in our use and creation of these technologies) in a similar way? With the same care, values, and time?**

In retrospect, these thoughts may have been inspired by a project I came across Summer 2024. [Tiny internets](https://tiny-inter.net/) focuses on web spaces, but I was interested in the process of technological design and the use of technologies more broadly. The project explores several questions around cultivating our web spaces - I find them so impactful and these questions probably re-wired my brain in some form:

> *"How can we make the web more natural and human-first rather than computers or institutions? How do we wish to interact with the internet beyond "browsing?‚Äù How would we shape the internet and our container for inhabiting it (currently, our browsers) if they were our neighborhoods and homes?"* - [tiny internets](https://tiny-inter.net/)

### Fermenting Things

#### Kimchi Time

After deciding to explore this topic further, instead of working on actually writing my paper, I spent a lot of time fermenting things. Partially because I wanted to learn through the process but also because I wanted to eat things.

Visiting my parents, we made a batch of kimchi (smaller than what my mother normally makes with larger groups of people). We were so lucky to have this delicious homemade gochugaru that came straight from our friend's mother in Korea.

A total of 5 people made this batch together. Many hands chopping, mixing, stirring, and jarring cabbage (and lots of test tasting).

We ended up with 14 jars of kimchi - I took one of these home with me to continue fermenting it.

#### Sourdough Time

In the meantime, I was also nurturing a jar of sourdough starter at home. I got a bit of this starter from a friend, who got it from a friend who originally got it from somebody in San Francisco and brought it across many borders while traveling. Does this make the microbial cultures in this jar an amalgamation of all of these locations it's lived in? How has it transformed after it's moved into my home, in a new jar, from the microbes in my air and on my hands?

My friend also wholeheartedly wrote this [How 2 Bread Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ffEtGJCZRuL3s4q6zVkWtBUokHpMA6rSVvUfWkyyBVQ/edit?usp=sharing) for me with sourdough making instructions - I had never grown a sourdough starter before or baked sourdough bread.

I learned a lot from nurturing and caring with this community of microbes in my jar - about the process of patience over time, observing tiny changes to know how to adjust the environment and feeding schedules. I also made my first sourdough loaf with it. It was good, but turned out a bit flatter than expected - I probably could have spent more time into the proofing/folding process to strengthen the gluten structures in the dough, but I was short on time in the midst of deadlines for school and work.

Should I have been baking bread under the guise of research instead of writing my paper?? Should I be telling you, Graham, that I was baking bread instead of writing my paper? I don't know, but it was delicious and gave me time to contemplate a lot of these ideas.

### Microscope Time

For fun, I also borrowed Joel Ong's microscope (thanks Joel!) to look at my kimchi and sourdough starter. The magnification wasn't strong enough to clearly view yeasts and bacteria as I was hoping, but it was a cool time to get up close and personal with these ferments.

You can mostly see the cabbage cells, chili oil, and what's probably CO2 bubbles. It was just for fun, so I didn't bother trying to source a microscope with higher magnification.
