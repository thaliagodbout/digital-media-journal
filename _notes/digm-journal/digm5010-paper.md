Notes, thoughts, and reflections on the process of developing my DIGM 5010 research paper.
</div>

This note describes my process for developing my research paper for DIGM 5010 - including the stages throughout class that provided guidance and structure, along with my thoughts, reflections, and learnings from the process.

A lot of my idea-forming process involves **jotting down rough notes** capturing any interesting thoughts that pop up as I go about my day doing other things - most often on the subway or in the middle of other activities like walking, cooking, or grabbing groceries. I like to marinate them in my brain and don't tend to document my thought process well, so journalling about it after the fact feels a bit unnatural (but it's been a very useful reflection activity).

Right now, I take these notes in my **travellers notebook** - I like it because it allows me to keep my quick notes from different areas of my life separate and organized into different interchangeable books. I'll include scans from my rough notes on this page.

## Early Explorations and Annotated Bibliographies

Earlier in the class, I knew I was interested in exploring slow technology and slow design. I've been interested in relationships with technology that move away from prioritizing efficiency and speed towards reflective, thoughtful, and deliberate interactions that are more sustainable and long-lasting.

I focused my annotated bibliography around these research areas, though afterwards I ended up diving into writings on temporality and time politics from feminist, queer, and critical disability perspectives. Reading bits of Sarah Sharma's [In the Meantime](https://www.dukeupress.edu/in-the-meantime) shifted my interests - questioning the assumptions of the world accelerating for everyone in it, she reveals the often unequal, entangled politics of temporal experience.

A lot of these explorations aligned with my research for my major research project (MRP) - there's been a lot of overlap/crossover/entanglement. This started with a small spread of keywords that I was interested in exploring and connecting, and which slowly grew throughout the term. This keyword map helped not only with developing my ideas for my MRP, but also with the trajectory of this research paper.

## Bringing Fermentation Into It

As we were approaching reading week, I was preparing to visit my parents - my mom and I had been planning to make kimchi with a friend and her mom, who was visiting from Korea and bringing her own mother's homemade gochugaru.

My mom has been making large batches of kimchi lately with communities of students, turning the act of fermentation into a collaborative act that brings people together, sharing the fruits of this collective labour with students, family, and friends within and beyond these circles. When my friends come over, she offers them a jar to take home. It's been fascinating to watch how these jars of bubbling, lively, fermented cabbage have been carefully cultivated by many different hands in my mother's kitchen, to be distributed to new hands and bellies. (We are not Korean - we're actually Vietnamese, but my mom loves fermented foods and has been really into learning from [Maangchi](https://www.maangchi.com/) and her Korean friends recently.)

## I'm not done with this! ah! eep!

There'll be more here soon. I'm still trying to transfer my messy notes into something readable here. If you're Graham, pls come back soon!! &#128534;
