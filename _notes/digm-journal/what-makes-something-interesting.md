Very brief notes from class.
</div>

- What is interesting? What does interesting actually mean?
- What makes games, art, and research interesting?
- During class, we talked about how "interesting" could mean:
    - There's something there to assimilate into existing knowledge (*but what is considered existing knowledge - what is recognized as valid knowledge that's acceptable for "assimilation"?* this was also talked about in discussions around [[what-is-research|what research is]].)
    - Something that can be understood by people (*how can we get research outputs beyond an academia bubble?*)
    - Interactive vs. reactive systems
        - Reactive systems respond with the same responce for the same input
        - Interactive systems respond in a way that accounts for previous inputs and their relationships
