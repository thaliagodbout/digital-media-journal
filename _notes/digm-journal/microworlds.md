<div class="overview">
A few small notes on microworlds from a class discussion on autonomous agents.
</div>

I was most interested in this [note from class](https://alicelab.world/digm5010/agents.html#/) and wanted to jot it down:

> The book (*Mindstorms*) describes this environment as a **microworld**: a place where a certain kind of knowledge can grow with ease, because of the basic materials that are ready-to-hand. For example, if you change the world such that one turtle can give another turtle instructions, suddenly a rich space of Kaledioscopic or fractal patterns becomes possible. Another microworld, in which turtles speak to each other with forces and are always in motion, lets children teach themselves Newtonian physics. Children were soon thinking about what else could be added to turtle-nature and world-nature...

**As a class, we also talked about how:**
- There's a lot that we can pull out of our childhood experiences of learning and developing how to think
    - Sometimes a core truth hidden in there, hidden by the habits we've developed living in the world
    - It's worth understanding these experiences
    - How we learn, how that works, how we reach people, encourage people to become active readers

**An interesting sidenote that came out of this discussion:**
- Hidden assumptions and biases embedded in machine intelligence
- Feeding it back into itself can often reveal the nature of the thing

## Some Roughly Formed Thoughts

- We talked about microworlds as a way to learn about mathematics, mechanics, and physics...
- What about as a way to explore the limits of possible worlds beyond our own?
- How can we draw from those foundational childhood experiences of learning and thinking?
    - During my childhood, I spent a lot of time engaging with and learning from online text-based roleplaying. What can I draw from this?
    - Can these kinds of embodied experiences help us to explore virtual microworlds?

Another key takeaway: I really like [this guy, his tortoises, and his love for his tortoises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLULRlmXkKo&ab_channel=skitterbot)
