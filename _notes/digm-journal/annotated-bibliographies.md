<div class="overview">
My early thoughts and ideas as a part of my [[digm5010-paper|DIGM 5010 Research Paper Process]].
</div>

Earlier in the class, I knew I was interested in exploring slow technology and slow design. I've been interested in relationships with technology that move away from prioritizing efficiency and speed towards reflective, thoughtful, and deliberate interactions that are more sustainable and long-lasting.

I focused my annotated bibliography around these research areas, though afterwards I ended up diving into writings on temporality and time politics from feminist, queer, and critical disability perspectives. Reading bits of Sarah Sharma's [In the Meantime](https://www.dukeupress.edu/in-the-meantime) shifted my interests - questioning the assumptions of the world accelerating for everyone in it, she reveals the often unequal, entangled politics of temporal experience.

A lot of these explorations aligned with my research for my major research project (MRP) - there's been a lot of overlap/crossover/entanglement. This started with a small spread of keywords that I was interested in exploring and connecting, and which slowly grew throughout the term. This keyword map helped not only with developing my ideas for my MRP, but also with the trajectory of this research paper.

My interests captured here in slow tech, speculative design, co-creation, and temporality certainly influenced this research paper and how I was thinking about it.
